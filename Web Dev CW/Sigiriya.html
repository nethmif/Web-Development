                    <p>The Sigiriya Rock Fortress is one of the most popular attractions in Sri Lanka, 
                    and it is known for its incredible architecture and engineering feats. The fortress

                    a moat and ramparts that were used to defend against invading armies. The complex 
                    also includes a series of terraced gardens, pools, and water features, which were 
                    designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                    <h2>Frescoes of Sigirya</h2>
                    <p>One of the most impressive features of Sigiriya is the frescoes that adorn the 
                    walls of the rock fortress. These paintings, which date back to the 5th century 
                    AD, are some of the oldest and best-preserved examples of ancient Sri Lankan art. 
                    The frescoes depict beautiful women, thought to be either apsaras (celestial dancers) 
                    or the king's consorts, and they are painted in bright colors and intricate patterns.</p>
